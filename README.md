## Analysis
### Counting Missing Values
We first counted the number of missing values in the dataset to determine how complete the data is. Out of a total of 3,179 products, only one column, last_visited, had more than 5% of missing values.
### Nike vs Adidas Pricing
We then explored the difference in price points between Nike and Adidas products by generating a distribution of the listing_price and the count for each price, grouped by brand. The query results indicate that Adidas has a wider range of prices compared to Nike.
## Conclusion
Our analysis has provided insight into the available data and the pricing differences between Nike and Adidas products. We recommend that the company investigate why there are so many missing last_visited values and consider strategies to address this issue. Furthermore, the company can consider adjusting the prices of their products to target a broader audience.
